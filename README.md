#  Faith Specialist Hospital Data Analysis

##  Overview
This project analyzes patient data from *Faith Specialist Hospital* to uncover insights that can guide better healthcare decisions, reduce discharges against medical advice (DAMA), and improve patient outcomes.  
Using *SQL*, the analysis explores hospital operations, patient demographics, chronic disease patterns, and mortality trends to provide actionable, data-driven recommendations.


##  Problem Statement
Faith Specialist Hospital, a key healthcare provider serving a diverse population, faces challenges in leveraging its extensive patient data to improve outcomes.  
The hospital has observed:
- Increasing numbers of *discharges against medical advice (DAMA)*
- A rising prevalence of *chronic diseases*
- Elevated *mortality rates* among specific patient groups  

This analysis aims to provide *data-driven insights* to address these issues and enhance hospital management and patient care.


##  Tools & Technologies
- *SQL:* Data cleaning, Querying, data extraction, and aggregation  


##  Key Insights

###  Discharge Against Medical Advice (DAMA)
- *Total Cases:* 275 (144 males, 131 females)  
- *Most Affected Age Group:* 15–47 years  
- *Education:* SSCE (119) and FSLC (118) had the highest DAMA rates  
- *Marital Status:* Married patients most likely to opt for DAMA  
- *Primary Cause:* Financial constraints  
- *Length of Stay (LOS):* Higher DAMA rates between 4–14 days of admission  


###  Mortality Analysis
- *Total Deaths:* 290  
- *Demographics:* Males and middle-aged (48–64 years) most affected  
- *Leading Causes:* Sepsis (primary), followed by cardiac arrest  
- *Highest Mortality Department:* Emergency Medicine  
- *Critical Periods:* Elevated mortality within 3 days and 4–7 days after admission  


###  Chronic Disease Prevalence
Stroke and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) had the highest prevalence with 33.46% and 31.24% respectively.

###  Lifestyle Factors & Mortality
- Patients *without alcohol, tobacco, or NSAID use* showed the highest mortality, especially among the middle-aged and elderly.  
- Among lifestyle-affected patients who died, *CKD* and *stroke* were most common.


###  Workforce & Specialty Workload
- *Total Doctors:* 39  
- *Highest Workload:* Emergency Medicine & Cardiology (only 2 doctors each)  
- *Findings:*
  - Emergency Medicine had the *highest DAMA and mortality rates*  
  - Cardiology also experienced significant workload pressure, impacting patient outcomes  


##  Recommendations
1. Strengthen *financial support programs* to reduce DAMA linked to economic barriers.  
2. Increase *staffing in high-workload departments* such as Emergency Medicine and Cardiology.  
3. Implement *early intervention protocols* within the first week of admission.  
4. Expand *chronic disease management programs* targeting stroke and CKD.  
5. Enhance *data-driven decision-making systems* for proactive care management.  


##  Key Takeaways
- DAMA and mortality are influenced by *socioeconomic factors, **disease type, and **staffing levels*.  
- Data analysis can guide *policy and resource allocation* to improve care quality and patient retention.  
- SQL is a powerful tool for generating impactful healthcare insights.
